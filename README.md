# MachineLearning
This repository is going to be composed of code I wrote to learn about machine learning from Andrew Ng's online class

I have uploaded my C# code, although I have octave code on my laptop still. I believe I have finished logistic and linear regresssion in C#. I am working on backpropagation currently, and the code concerning backpropagation is incomplete. There's also incomplete code about the K Clustering algorithm which I hope to finish after backpropagation. I have finished these topics in the online class, but I decided to take a step back in order to fully process the two algorithms, which is why I am taking so long.

I have decided to upload my original Octave classwork. I plan to finish those classes when I have the time.
